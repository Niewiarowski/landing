Let's rewind back to early 2019. At this point I had had my Intel i7-4790K @ 4.6GHz setup for about 6 years. To cool this space heater, I needed something beefy. The first liquid cooler I tried was a 240mm Cooler Master one. I wasn't too happy with the performance of it unfortunately. That was when I decided to switch to an NZXT Kraken X61. Back then, it was basically the coolest (literally) liquid cooler you could get for the processor. I've had the liquid cooler for at least 4 years at this point. It's an awesome cooler, even if it isn't as fancy as some of the newer RGB models anymore.

Well, it was *nearly* perfect.

What was my problem with the cooler? Nothing. The hardware wasn't the issue, but the software. NZXT Cam had come a long way from 2016 to 2019, but it was *constantly* using ~5~10% of my CPU back then. 

Some time around 2019 I decided that I had enough. I decided to investigate.

I fired up Process Hacker and Fiddler and started investigating.
